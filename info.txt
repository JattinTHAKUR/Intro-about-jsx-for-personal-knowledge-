Jsx is nothing but a html which is wearing a mask of javascript i.e. the whole code is written in Js but the name and classes are used just like html that is why it is called jsx.

Jsx is nothing but simple HTML, which is replaced by {
    class => className 
    for => htmlFor
    tab => indexTab
    
}
